Microservices-Based E-Commerce Platform: A Comprehensive Project Description
Introduction
In today’s digital economy, e-commerce platforms must be scalable, resilient, and capable of handling high traffic loads. Traditional monolithic architectures struggle with these demands, leading to the adoption of microservices—a design pattern where applications are broken down into small, independently deployable services.

This project involved building a scalable e-commerce platform using Java, Spring Boot, and cloud-native technologies, following microservices principles. The system was designed to handle high traffic, ensure fault tolerance, and provide seamless user experiences while maintaining security and performance.

Project Architecture & Components
1. Microservices Breakdown
The application was decomposed into multiple services, each responsible for a specific business function:

Product Service – Manages product catalog, inventory, and pricing.

Order Service – Processes orders, tracks order status, and manages transactions.

User Service – Handles authentication, authorization, and user profiles.

Payment Service – Integrates with payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal).

Notification Service – Sends emails/SMS for order confirmations and alerts.

API Gateway – Acts as a single entry point for all client requests.

Each service was developed as an independent Spring Boot application, ensuring loose coupling and scalability.

2. Technology Stack
Backend: Java 11, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud

Databases: PostgreSQL (RDBMS), Redis (caching)

Messaging: RabbitMQ (asynchronous communication)

Containerization: Docker, Kubernetes (AWS EKS)

Cloud Services: AWS (EC2, RDS, S3, EKS)

CI/CD: Jenkins, GitHub Actions

Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

Key Features & Implementation Details
1. RESTful API Development
Each microservice exposed REST APIs following best practices:

HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) – Responses included links to related resources.

Proper HTTP Status Codes – Used 200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found, etc.

Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation – Automated API documentation for easy integration.

Example:

Product Service API

GET /api/products – Fetch all products

POST /api/products – Add a new product

GET /api/products/{id} – Get product details

2. Database Per Service Pattern
To ensure loose coupling:

Each service had its own database (PostgreSQL for transactional data).

Redis was used for caching high-frequency data (e.g., product inventory).

Event Sourcing was implemented in the Order Service to maintain an audit log of all changes.

3. Inter-Service Communication
Microservices communicated via:

Synchronous REST Calls (for immediate responses)

Used Spring WebClient (reactive) for service-to-service calls.

Asynchronous Messaging (RabbitMQ)

Orders were processed asynchronously to avoid bottlenecks.

Example: When an order was placed, the Order Service published an event to RabbitMQ, which the Payment Service consumed.

Event-Driven Architecture

Services emitted events (e.g., OrderPlaced, PaymentProcessed).

Other services subscribed to relevant events.

4. Distributed Transactions with Saga Pattern
Since microservices don’t support ACID transactions across databases, we used the Saga Pattern:

Choreography-Based Saga: Each service emitted events, and others reacted accordingly.

Compensation Logic: If a step failed (e.g., payment failed), the system rolled back previous steps (e.g., released reserved inventory).

5. API Gateway & Service Discovery
Spring Cloud Gateway acted as the entry point, handling:

Routing (/orders → Order Service, /products → Product Service)

Authentication (JWT validation)

Rate limiting

Netflix Eureka provided service discovery, allowing dynamic scaling.

6. Security Implementation
OAuth2 & JWT for authentication.

Spring Security for role-based access control (RBAC).

Vault (Hashicorp) for managing secrets (DB passwords, API keys).

Mutual TLS (mTLS) for secure service-to-service communication.

7. Cloud Deployment & CI/CD Pipeline
Dockerized each microservice for consistency.

Kubernetes (AWS EKS) for orchestration (auto-scaling, load balancing).

Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline:

Build: Maven compilation, unit tests.

Test: Integration tests with TestContainers.

Deploy: Blue-green deployment to AWS EKS.

8. Observability & Monitoring
Prometheus + Grafana for real-time metrics (CPU, memory, latency).

ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging.

Distributed Tracing (Zipkin) to track requests across services.

Health Checks with Spring Boot Actuator.

Challenges & Solutions
1. Handling High Traffic (Scalability)
Problem: During peak sales, the system needed to handle 10x traffic.

Solution:

Horizontal Scaling: Kubernetes auto-scaling (HPA) based on CPU/memory.

Caching: Redis reduced database load for product listings.

2. Ensuring Data Consistency
Problem: Without distributed transactions, orders could get stuck in an inconsistent state.

Solution:

Saga Pattern with compensating transactions.

Event Sourcing to replay events if failures occurred.

3. Debugging in a Distributed System
Problem: Tracking a request across multiple services was difficult.

Solution:

Distributed Tracing (Zipkin) visualized request flows.

Centralized Logging (ELK) helped correlate logs.

4. Zero-Downtime Deployments
Problem: Traditional deployments caused downtime.

Solution:

Blue-Green Deployment in Kubernetes.

Canary Releases for gradual rollouts.

Results & Impact
Scalability: Handled 10,000+ concurrent users during Black Friday.

Performance: Reduced 95th percentile API response time from 1200ms to 250ms.

Reliability: Achieved 99.99% uptime with circuit breakers (Resilience4j).

DevOps Efficiency: Deployment time reduced from 2 hours to 15 minutes.
